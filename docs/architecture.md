## 1. System Overview

Smart Flow is a **3-module pipeline** that converts a CCTV video stream into a
real-time 3D Digital Twin rendered in a web browser.

```
CCTV (RTSP)
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────┐     JSON payload      ┌─────────────┐     WebSocket     ┌──────────────┐
│  AI Worker  │ ──────────────────▶   │   Backend   │ ────────────────▶ │    Unity     │
│  (Python)   │   HTTP POST /ingest   │  (Node.js)  │   emit("frame")   │   (WebGL)    │
└─────────────┘                       └─────────────┘                   └──────────────┘
                                             │
                                             ▼
                                      ┌─────────────┐
                                      │ TimescaleDB │
                                      │  (log only) │
                                      └─────────────┘
```

During development, **Mock Server** replaces AI Worker entirely.
Backend cannot tell the difference — same JSON format, same endpoint.

```
Mock Server  ──────────────────▶  Backend  ──────▶  Unity
(Node.js)       HTTP POST /ingest
```

## 2. Module Responsibilities

### AI Worker (`/ai-worker`)
- Pull frames from RTSP stream via OpenCV
- Detect and track vehicles using YOLOv8
- Convert 2D bounding box center → 3D world coordinates (Homography)
- Validate output against data contract schema
- POST JSON payload to Backend every ~1 second

**Does NOT:** store data, manage connections, or know about Unity.

### Backend (`/backend`)
- Receive JSON payload from AI Worker (or Mock Server) via `POST /ingest`
- Validate incoming payload (schema check before any processing)
- Broadcast payload to all connected Unity clients via WebSocket (`emit("frame")`)
- Asynchronously log each frame to TimescaleDB
- Expose a simple health check endpoint `GET /health`

**Does NOT:** process images, run AI, or know about Unity's rendering logic.

### Unity Frontend (`/unity`)
- Connect to Backend WebSocket on startup
- Receive `frame` events and update vehicle positions
- Manage car models using Object Pooling (pool size: 120)
- Smooth movement between frames using `Vector3.Lerp`
- Render on WebGL build target (Chrome-compatible)

**Does NOT:** compute coordinates, store data, or call any API directly.

### Mock Server (`/mock-server`)
- Simulate AI Worker output for development and demo
- Support 3 scenarios: `normal`, `congestion`, `edge`
- POST to the same `/ingest` endpoint as the real AI Worker
- Vehicles move continuously (bounce within road boundary)

## 3. Data Flow (Detail)

```
1. AI Worker detects vehicles in frame N
2. For each vehicle: compute (x, y=0, z) in world space via Homography
3. Build JSON payload (see data-contract.md for schema)
4. POST to http://localhost:3000/api/ingest
5. Backend validates payload → rejects with 400 if invalid
6. Backend emits payload to all WebSocket clients
7. Backend inserts row into TimescaleDB (async, non-blocking)
8. Unity receives "frame" event
9. Unity updates car positions in pool → Lerp toward new position
10. Unity hides cars not present in latest frame
```

## 4. Tech Stack

| Module | Technology | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Worker | Python | 3.11 | |
| | OpenCV | 4.x | RTSP capture |
| | Ultralytics YOLOv8 | latest stable | Object detection + tracking |
| Backend | Node.js | 20 LTS | |
| | Express | 4.x | HTTP server |
| | Socket.io | 4.x | WebSocket abstraction |
| | TimescaleDB | 2.x | Via Docker |
| Frontend | Unity | 2022 LTS | WebGL build target |
| | C# | — | Unity scripting |
| Mock Server | Node.js | 20 LTS | Same runtime as backend |
| Infra | Docker Compose | — | Local + on-premise |

## 5. Tech Decisions (Why)

### Why TimescaleDB instead of MongoDB
Traffic logs are pure time-series data. Every query will be time-range based
(e.g. "vehicles between 08:00–09:00"). TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension
optimized for exactly this pattern — range queries are significantly faster
and storage is compressed automatically. MongoDB would work but is not
optimized for this workload. Setup complexity is similar for MVP.

### Why on-premise instead of AWS (MVP)
RTSP stream from CCTV is on KMITL's internal network. Routing it to a cloud
server adds unnecessary latency and creates a security exposure. On-premise
eliminates both issues. AWS remains an option for Phase 2 if public access
or scaling is required.

### Why Mock-First development
The 3 modules have hard dependencies on each other. If AI Worker is not
ready, Backend and Unity teams cannot develop. Mock Server breaks this
dependency — all 3 modules can be developed and tested in parallel from
day 1. It also gives us a reliable demo fallback if CCTV is unavailable.

### Why Unity WebGL instead of a web-only 3D library (e.g. Three.js)
Object Pooling and Lerp interpolation in Unity are mature, well-documented
patterns for exactly this use case (100+ moving objects, position updates
every second). The team already has Unity experience. Three.js would require
reimplementing the same patterns from scratch.

### Why Monorepo
Team size is 2. Multi-repo adds overhead (separate CI, versioning, cloning)
with no benefit at this scale. A single repo lets Claude (and teammates)
read cross-module context without switching directories.

## 6. Business Rules

These rules must be reflected in code. They are not optional.

| Rule | Where enforced |
|---|---|
| Confidence < 0.5 → discard detection | AI Worker |
| `trackId` must be stable across frames for the same vehicle | AI Worker (ByteTrack) |
| `y` is always `0.0` (ground plane) for MVP | AI Worker + Validation |
| Payload with missing `position.x/z` → reject with HTTP 400 | Backend validation |
| `NaN` or `Infinity` in any coordinate → reject | Backend validation |
| Pool size cap: 120 vehicles max per frame | Unity |
| Lerp duration: ≤ 1.5 seconds to next position | Unity |
| Frame interval target: ~1 second | AI Worker |

## 8. What This Is NOT (MVP Scope Limits)

- ❌ No NavMesh / AI traffic simulation inside Unity
- ❌ No environmental sensors (PM2.5, carbon) — planned for Phase 2
- ❌ No multi-camera support — 1 camera only
- ❌ No cloud deployment — on-premise only
- ❌ No user authentication on the WebSocket feed
